The goal of this project is to determine the diversity, distribution and pathogenecity of *Fusarium* species in the Northern High Plains of Texas.

## Abstract

The recent expansion of cotton acreage in the Northern High Plains of Texas has raised concerns about the occurrence of a diverse *Fusarium* community, particularly *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *vasinfectum* race 4, which is favored by cool early-season temperatures that often occur in the region. This study investigated the diversity, distribution, and pathogenicity of *Fusarium* species associated with cotton and corn fields across 10 counties in the Northern High Plains. A total of nine *Fusarium* species were isolated: *F. incarnatum*, *F. equiseti*, *F. solani*, *F. verticillioides*, *F. proliferatum*, *F. clavum*, *F. oxysporum*, *F. flocciferum*, and one unidentified *Fusarium* sp. The highest species diversity was observed in Sherman County. *Fusarium solani* was the most frequently isolated species (39%) across all counties, followed by *F. equiseti* (22%), while *F. flocciferum* was the least frequent (2%). Pathogenicity assays conducted under greenhouse conditions showed that *F. incarnatum* caused significantly higher disease severity on aerial parts of cotton, while *F. flocciferum* and *F. proliferatum* caused significantly higher disease severity on roots. On corn, *F. proliferatum* caused significantly higher disease severity. *Fusarium* isolates were recovered from both symptomatic and asymptomatic roots following pathogenicity trials, suggesting endophytic colonization. This study revealed a complex *Fusarium* community capable of cross-infecting cotton and corn, with implications for regional disease management. The absence of *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *vasinfectum* race 4 indicates that it may not yet have been introduced into the Northern High Plains; however, continued surveillance is warranted given its detection in New Mexico and adjacent counties in Texas.

## Reproducibility and data availability

This analysis is fully reproducible. All data from this work are included in this repository in the "data" folder. Code used for importing data, data munging, visualisation and model fitting are available to run in R Markdown vignettes, including extra instruction for which we did not have space in the paper.
